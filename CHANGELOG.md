## [5.21.0] — 2026-05-27 — Lambda literals as higher-order arguments (E2-next)
- **Lambda literals can now be passed as function arguments and proven in ZK.** v5.14's higher-order support took only top-level function *names* (`twice(inc, x)`); the unroll's `fenv` now maps a function-valued parameter to a function *value* — a top-level fn **or** an `ELam` — so a lambda literal argument (and a directly-applied lambda) is inlined too. [`prove_source_adt_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_adt_zk.glass): `fn twice(f: (Int) -> Int, x) : Int where (result != 0) = f(f(x)); twice(fn(n) -> n + 1, inp)` proves `(inp+1)+1 = 7` over a private input **and** its refinement in-circuit (ACCEPT); lying `ident` REJECTs; two seeds verify with a differing opening (ZK). The whole higher-order program is still beta-reduced to a first-order, call-free circuit (no closures in the proof); a lambda's captured variables resolve via the enclosing `let`s in the unrolled term. Self-hosted byte-identical (ng=32). Regression-checked: top-level-fn HOF, recursion, and recursive-list folds all still pass with the generalized `fenv`. This is **E2-next**.

## [5.20.0] — 2026-05-27 — Real Glass source → a ZK proof over Goldilocks (the source front-end, wired in)
- **Real prism-parsed Glass source now proves over the production field.** [`prove_source_goldilocks_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_goldilocks_zk.glass) wires the source front-end into the Goldilocks backend: source text → **prism parse** → **unroll** (calls and higher-order arguments inlined to a call-free term) → a **Goldilocks `cgen`** (lowers `+`/`-`/`*`/`let` to gates + a bignum witness) → the **R1b cryptographic STARK** (committed, F_{p²}-challenged via Fiat-Shamir, query-verified, blinded). The output wire *is* the function's result, so claiming a wrong value breaks the gate that produced it. Demo: `fn sq(n) = n * n; fn f(x) = sq(x) + 5; f(inp)` proves `f(inp) = inp²+5` over Goldilocks (2⁶⁴, no 2³¹ wrap) — honest ACCEPT, tampered REJECT, two blinding seeds → different commitments (ZK). Self-hosted byte-identical. This advances **R1** (wire Goldilocks through the bridge): *write Glass source, get a succinct zero-knowledge proof on the field real provers use.* **Scope:** the hint-free arithmetic subset (`+`, `-`, `*`, `let`, calls inlined) — exactly the subset `prove_source_zk` began with, now on the real field; comparisons / `match` / ADTs (which need is-zero inverse-hint wires in the bignum witness) and the heavier circuits are the remaining step.

## [5.19.0] — 2026-05-27 — The Goldilocks circuit proof, now a full cryptographic STARK (R1b complete)
- **R1b's Goldilocks gate quotient is upgraded from a fixed base-field fold to the full cryptographic STARK.** [`prove_circuit_goldilocks_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_circuit_goldilocks_zk.glass) now embeds the quotient codeword into **F_{p²}**, blinds it, and **Merkle-commits each FRI layer**; the fold challenge **β ∈ F_{p²} ≈ 2¹²⁸** is derived from each layer's root (**Fiat-Shamir**, so unpredictable), and sampled query positions are **opened against the commitment** — a prover whose Q isn't low-degree is caught at (almost) every query. Honest → 8 Fiat-Shamir queries all verify (ACCEPT); tampered → the queries catch the inconsistency (REJECT); two blinding seeds → different layer-0 commitments (ZK). So the proof is now **committed, F_{p²}-challenged, query-verified, and blinded** — the production STARK shape, on the production field. (FRI-over-F_{p²} + Merkle from `frost_goldilocks_zk`, applied to the gate quotient.) Self-hosted byte-identical; closes the honest-scope gap noted in v5.17. **Remaining:** wire it into the full source bridge (`prove_source_*` still computes over Baby Bear).

## [5.18.0] — 2026-05-27 — README, re-voiced
- Rewrote the [README](README.md) to carry the project's deeper current — faithful re-execution, two independent reconstructions forced to meet at every bit, and a proof of what a computation did — around the same factual claims and commands. "It compiles itself" → "It reconstructs itself" (the differential-testing discipline framed as replay-and-check: diverge and it's a desync, the build stops); "It proves itself" → "It proves what happened."
- Surfaced the [soundness ledger](docs/soundness.md) on the front page (the "Where to go" table and Status): *nothing taken on faith, including the faith you'd place in it.*

## [5.17.0] — 2026-05-27 — A Glass circuit proven succinctly + ZK over Goldilocks (R1b)
- **A Glass arithmetic circuit, proven SUCCINCTLY and in zero-knowledge over the production field.** R1 (`prove_circuit_goldilocks.glass`) proved a circuit over Goldilocks (p = 2⁶⁴−2³²+1) with a sound but *linear-verifier* RLC. R1b ([`prove_circuit_goldilocks_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_circuit_goldilocks_zk.glass)) makes it **succinct**: the gate constraints become a single low-degree polynomial, FRI-tested. The construction is `prove_quotient`'s (Baby Bear), **ported to Goldilocks in base-2¹⁶ bignum limbs** — lay the gates in rows with selector columns `qa/qm/qs/qc` + value columns `l/r/o/c`; interpolate each over the trace domain H (N=8) by an **inverse NTT**; the gate identity lifts to `G(x) = qa·(o−(l+r)) + qm·(o−l·r) + qs·(o−(l−r)) + qc·(o−c)`, which vanishes on H ⟺ every gate holds; so `Q = G/Z_H` (Z_H = xᴺ−1) is genuinely **low-degree iff the constraints hold**. Evaluate Q on a 32-coset and FRI-fold: honest → folds to a constant (**ACCEPT**); tamper any wire → G stops vanishing, Q isn't a polynomial, the fold doesn't reach a constant (**REJECT**). The output binds the claim automatically (claiming a wrong `f(x)` breaks the gate that produced it). **Zero-knowledge:** Q is blinded with a random low-degree mask — FRI is linear, so Q+R still folds to a constant and ACCEPTs, but every opened value is randomized (two seeds → two different valid proofs of the same statement). Demo: `f(x) = x*x + 5` over a private 2⁶⁴-range input (no 2³¹ wrap), honest ACCEPT / tampered REJECT / two seeds verify with a differing opening. Self-hosted byte-identical (heavy bignum — run via `run_native.sh`). This is the roadmap's **R1b**: succinct + ZK over the real field, retiring the Baby Bear value-range cap for the proven circuit. **Honest scope:** the fold uses a fixed base-field challenge here; the cryptographic F_{p²} fold challenge + Merkle query-verification (built for codewords in `frost_goldilocks_zk`) are the next wiring step — the same Stage-3 → Stage-4 split the Baby Bear bridge used.

## [5.16.0] — 2026-05-27 — A domain-separated Fiat-Shamir transcript (R2, step 2)
- **A Fiat-Shamir transcript with domain separation, built on the Grain Poseidon.** [`frost_grain.glass`](examples/frost/frost_grain.glass) gains `tr_init`/`tr_absorb`/`tr_challenge`: a non-interactive proof derives its challenges by hashing the transcript of prover messages, and soundness needs **domain separation** — a challenge meant for "fold round 2" must never coincide with one meant for "query index", even at the same transcript state. Every absorb and squeeze is **tagged by an integer role**, folded in *before* the value (`state' = H(H(s, tag), v)`), so `(tag, v)` for different roles can't collide. A scripted FRI-like protocol (commit → fold challenge → bind back → commit → query index) demonstrates: **determinism** (same script → same challenges), **domain separation** (tag 20 ≠ tag 30 at the same state), **no (tag,value) collision**, and **binding to history** (tampering the first commitment changes every later challenge). Self-hosted byte-identical. This is roadmap **R2 step 2** (the soundness ledger's Fiat-Shamir row is updated). **Honest scope:** domain separation is implemented and demonstrated, but there's no formal transcript-separation *proof*, and it isn't yet wired into the prove bridge's challenges.

## [5.15.0] — 2026-05-27 — Poseidon round constants from the Grain LFSR (R2, first step)
- **Poseidon's round constants now come from the spec's Grain LFSR, not a hand-picked schedule.** [`frost_grain.glass`](examples/frost/frost_grain.glass) implements the Poseidon Grain LFSR from scratch: an 80-bit state initialized from the concrete parameters (field flag, S-box type, field size, `t`, `R_F`, `R_P`, then thirty 1s), feedback taps `b₀⊕b₁₃⊕b₂₃⊕b₃₈⊕b₅₁⊕b₆₂`, a 160-round warm-up, and **rejection sampling** (draw `n` bits MSB-first, redraw if ≥ p) so every constant is a uniform residue. Glass has no bitwise ops, so a bit is an `Int ∈ {0,1}`, XOR is `(a+b)%2`, and the state is a `List<Int>`. It generates the 90 constants (30 rounds × 3 lanes) and feeds the same `x⁷` Poseidon permutation — which stays deterministic, order-sensitive, collision-free on samples, and avalanching. Self-hosted byte-identical. This is the first step of roadmap **R2** and directly addresses the hash caveat in [`docs/soundness.md`](docs/soundness.md) (the ledger is updated). **Honest scope:** the construction follows the spec's *structure* but is **not yet cross-checked against Poseidon's official reference test vectors**, the MDS/round-counts aren't analyzed, and the hash is unaudited — a real upgrade over hand-picked constants, not a final word.

## [5.14.0] — 2026-05-27 — Higher-order functions in zero-knowledge (E2)
- **A higher-order function — one that takes another function as an argument — proven in zero-knowledge.** The `unroll` pre-pass now carries an `fenv` mapping a function-valued *parameter* to the top-level function it was passed (`fn twice(f, x) = f(f(x)); twice(inc, …)` binds `f → inc`). When a call's head resolves through `fenv` to a top-level fn, it inlines that fn — so the higher-order program is **beta-reduced to a first-order, call-free term**, and `heval`/`cgen` need *zero* changes (higher-order source, first-order proof; no closures in the circuit). The `fenv` threads through the recursion, so a **recursive** higher-order function works too: `suml(map(inc, Cons(5, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil))))) = 13` proves correctly (verified). [`prove_source_adt_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_adt_zk.glass)'s demo proves `twice(inc, inp) = 7` over a *private* input **and** its refinement `where (result != 0)` in-circuit (ACCEPT, ng=32); the lying `ident` REJECTs; two seeds verify with different openings (ZK). Self-hosted byte-identical. Reachable via `glass prove` — [`map_prove.glass`](examples/prove/map_prove.glass) composes HOF + recursion + lists. This is the roadmap's **E2**. (Scope: top-level function names as arguments — the canonical HOF case; capturing lambda literals are future work.)

## [5.13.0] — 2026-05-27 — Recursive datatypes (linked lists) in zero-knowledge (E1-next)
- **A fold over a recursive linked list, proven in zero-knowledge — with no new machinery.** A recursive datatype `type IntList = Nil | Cons(Int, IntList)` lays out as a **fixed-width buffer** (the type-directed `twidth` already bounds a recursive type's wire-width by a depth fuel), and a recursive fold `fn suml(l) = match l { Nil => 0; Cons(h, t) => h + suml(t) }` is **bounded-unrolled** by the v5.12 pass — so an entire linked list *and* the fold over it compile to one arithmetic circuit. The two bounds compose: the multi-wire ADT layout (since the ADT bridge) supplies the recursive *data*, and the unroll pre-pass supplies the recursive *function*. [`prove_source_adt_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_adt_zk.glass)'s demo proves `suml(Cons(inp, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)))) = 10` over a *private* head **and** its refinement `where (result != 99)` in-circuit (ACCEPT); a wrong claim or the lying `ident` REJECTs; two seeds verify with different openings (ZK). Self-hosted byte-identical (ng=256). Reachable via `glass prove` — [`list_sum_prove.glass`](examples/prove/list_sum_prove.glass). This is the roadmap's **E1-next**: the recursive-datatype frontier, reached by *composition* — the cleanest kind of progress. (Scope: lists bounded by the layout/unroll fuel — exact for depth ≤ 5.)

## [5.12.0] — 2026-05-27 — Bounded recursion in the prove bridge (E1)
- **A recursive function can now be proven in zero-knowledge.** [`prove_source_adt_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_adt_zk.glass) gains a source-level **unroll pre-pass** (`unroll`/`inline_fn`): a self-recursive call is inlined to a fixed depth, with each call rewritten as `let p = arg in body` — so an argument used many times is still evaluated once (no duplicate gates), and the unrolled term is **call-free**, so the circuit generator never recurses on `EApp`. Past the bound a call lowers to `0`; for inputs within the bound the base case fires first, so the cutoff sits in a branch the `if`/`match` discards and the result is exact. The same transform runs on `glass.py` and on native (and `ref_result` unrolls too), so the claimed result and the circuit agree on the same bounded semantics — and it stays byte-identical.
- **Demo — recursion ⊕ refinement, fused:** `fn fact(n) : Int where (result != 0) = if n == 0 then 1 else n * fact(n - 1)` proves `fact(5) = 120` over a *private* input **and** proves its own `where` clause in-circuit (ACCEPT); the lying `ident` still REJECTs; two seeds verify with different openings (ZK). Recursive functions are also reachable through `glass prove` — see [`fact_prove.glass`](examples/prove/fact_prove.glass). This is the roadmap's **E1**. (Scope: recursion bounded by a fixed unroll depth — the honest limit of a circuit model, which has no unbounded loops.)

## [5.11.0] — 2026-05-26 — An honest soundness ledger (R3)
- **[`docs/soundness.md`](docs/soundness.md) — what Glass's proofs actually guarantee.** With "zero-knowledge proof" claimed across 30+ files and the repo public, this is the integrity ledger: it separates the **strong, real differential-testing guarantee** (glass.py ⟷ native_glassc byte-identical, the bootstrap fixpoint — a correctness/consistency guarantee) from the **educational-grade cryptography** (Baby Bear's ~2³¹ value range, the F_{p⁴} ≈ 2¹²⁴ *challenge* space which *is* cryptographic-width, the unaudited MiMC/Poseidon hash with non-standard round constants, no parameter analysis or audit). Per-component table, what `glass prove` specifically does/doesn't guarantee, the ordered path to production-soundness, and a blunt bottom line: *Glass is a complete, self-hosted **demonstration** of a zk-STARK and a ZK-native language — not production cryptography; do not use it to protect real value.* Linked from the docs index. This is the roadmap's **R3**, and it's the responsible counterweight to the capability claims.

## [5.10.0] — 2026-05-26 — Proving a function's refinement type in zero-knowledge (C1)
- **Glass proves its own refinement types in zero-knowledge.** [`prove_source_adt_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_adt_zk.glass) extracts a function's return refinement — `fn f(..) : Int where (P) = ..` parses to a return type `TyRefine(Int, "result", P)` — binds `result` to the circuit's output, lowers the predicate `P` to gates, and asserts it. The `where` clause becomes a **cryptographic guarantee about the result**, not just a runtime check, and a function that *violates* its declared refinement is **unprovable** (the in-circuit assertion fails). Demo: `fn classify(x) : Int where (result == 0 || result == 1) = if x == 0 then 0 else 1` proves ACCEPT (the result is a bit), while `fn ident(x) : Int where (result == 0 || result == 1) = x` REJECTs (5 ∉ {0,1}). Two seeds verify with different openings (ZK). This is the roadmap's **C1** — the convergence of types and zero-knowledge, which no other language can do because none has the type system and the prover in one self-hosting language.
- **Fixed a latent gap:** the ADT source-bridge's `cgen`/`heval` were missing `||`, `&&`, `!=`, and `!` (its demos only exercised `match`/ADTs); they now lower correctly (`&&`→`a·b`, `||`→`a+b−ab`, `!`→`1−a`, `!=`→`1−(a==b)`). Self-hosted byte-identical.

## [5.9.0] — 2026-05-26 — Tuples in the prove bridge
- **The source→ZK bridge now handles tuples.** [`prove_source_adt_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_adt_zk.glass) supports `ETuple`/`PTuple`/`TyTuple`: a tuple `(a, b)` is a **tagless** multi-wire value (just the concatenation of its elements — no constructor tag), `(x, y)` patterns always match and bind positionally, and a function may **return** a tuple (the result mux is element-wise over its wires). Demo: `fn swap(p: (Int, Int)) : (Int, Int) = match p { (x, y) => (y, x) }; fn first(p) = match p { (a, b) => a }; first(swap((inp, 7)))` over a *private* `inp` proves the result = 7 — honest ACCEPT, lying REJECT, ZK. Self-hosted byte-identical. (Scope: tuples of scalar elements — the common case; reuses the type-directed layout via a synthetic width-1-per-element type list. Also reachable through `glass prove`.)

## [5.8.0] — 2026-05-26 — `glass prove` — the zero-knowledge prover as a command (U1)
- **The prove bridge is now a tool, not a pile of demo files.** `glass prove <file.glass> [name=value …]` compiles the file's `main` expression into an arithmetic circuit and emits a succinct, zero-knowledge proof of its result. Names passed on the command line are **private inputs** — they stay in the witness; the proof reveals only the result. The prove logic stays in Glass (the command assembles a driver over `prove_source_adt_zk.glass`, the most complete bridge — arithmetic, `let`, calls, `==`/`if`, and `match` over nested ADTs), so there's no second implementation to keep honest. Example: `glass prove examples/prove/hello_prove.glass inp=9` → `result: 86`, `proof: ACCEPT (succinct, zero-knowledge)`. This is the roadmap's **U1** — "a feature, not a library you assemble by hand." (`glass prove` both proves and verifies; the heavy STARK runs interpreted, so keep inputs small or use the native path for scale.)

## [5.7.0] — 2026-05-26 — A Glass circuit proven over the real field (Goldilocks) — R1
- **The prove bridge reaches the production field.** Every bridge proof so far computed over toy Baby Bear (values mod 2³¹, which wrap). [`prove_circuit_goldilocks.glass`](examples/prove/prove_circuit_goldilocks.glass) compiles a Glass arithmetic circuit (`f(x) = x*x + 5`, plus a `GEq` binding the output to a public claim `R`) and proves it over **Goldilocks** (p = 2⁶⁴ − 2³² + 1, the field Plonky2/RISC Zero use): real 64-bit-range values, no wraparound. The argument is the sound RLC — commit the witness (a Goldilocks MiMC hash), derive a challenge γ ∈ **F_{p²} ≈ 2¹²⁸** from the commitment (Fiat-Shamir), and check `Σ residualᵢ·γⁱ == 0`; by Schwartz–Zippel a violated gate makes the RLC nonzero except with probability ~(#gates)/2¹²⁸. Honest ACCEPT, lying about `R` REJECT. Int64-safe (base-2¹⁶ limbs), dogfoods byte-identical. This is **R1**'s dogfoodable first step (sound + real-field); succinct + zero-knowledge over Goldilocks — the FRI quotient over bignum — is the heavier native-primary follow-on, mirroring the Baby Bear RLC→FRI progression.

## [5.6.0] — 2026-05-26 — Nested patterns (destructure a nested ADT in one match)
- **Structured pattern matching is now complete to arbitrary depth.** [`prove_source_adt_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_adt_zk.glass) handles nested constructor patterns: `match l { L(P(x, y), b) => x + y }` destructures the inner `Point` directly. The arm selector becomes the **product of is-zeros down the pattern tree** (tag = L *and* field 0's tag = P), `psel`/`pmatch`/`psel_hint` recurse into field patterns (slicing each sub-value by type width), and binders recurse too (a `PVar` at any depth binds its slice). Demo: `type Point = P(Int,Int); type Line = L(Point, Point); fn endx(l) = match l { L(P(x, y), b) => x + y }; endx(L(P(inp, 7), P(2, 3)))` over a *private* `inp` proves the result = 12 — honest ACCEPT, lying REJECT, ZK. Self-hosted byte-identical. The source→ZK bridge now covers the full first-order pure-functional core over real prism Glass: arithmetic, let, calls, comparisons/booleans, if, and `match` over (nested) ADTs with (nested) patterns.

## [5.5.0] — 2026-05-26 — Nested ADTs (a field can be an ADT), via type-directed layout
- **The source→ZK bridge handles ADTs whose fields are themselves ADTs.** [`prove_source_adt_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_adt_zk.glass) gains a **type-directed layout**: a value's wire-width is computed from the type declarations (`twidth` — a sum type padded to its widest constructor), so `ECtor` pads each field to its declared width and a `match`/`PCtor` slices fields out of the flat wire list by those widths (`slicew`). A `Line` holding two `Point`s lays out as one list `[tagL, tagP,x,y, tagP,x,y]`; `fst(l) = match l { L(a, b) => a }` slices the first `Point` sub-value (itself an ADT) and returns it. Demo: `type Point = P(Int,Int); type Line = L(Point, Point); fn fst(l) = match l { L(a,b) => a }; fn sm(p) = match p { P(x,y) => x+y }; sm(fst(L(P(inp,1), P(2,3))))` over a *private* `inp` proves the result = 6 — honest ACCEPT, lying REJECT, ZK. Self-hosted byte-identical. (Bounded to non-recursive types via a depth fuel; field patterns are `PVar`/`PWild` — nested `PCtor` *inside* a field pattern is the next layer.)

## [5.4.0] — 2026-05-26 — ADT-returning matches (a match can build an ADT)
- **The source→ZK bridge now handles matches that *return* an ADT.** [`prove_source_adt_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_adt_zk.glass) generalizes the match-result multiplexer from a single wire to **element-wise over the body's wires** (`accw`): the result accumulator starts empty and the first arm establishes the body's width, so a function like `fn mv(p) = match p { P(x, y) => P(x + 1, y + 2) }` — whose match body builds a `Point` — compiles, with each output wire `result_i += eff·body_i`. Demo: `type Point = P(Int, Int); fn mv(p) = match p { P(x,y) => P(x+1, y+2) }; fn sm(p) = match p { P(x,y) => x+y }; sm(mv(P(inp, inp)))` over a *private* `inp` proves the result = 13 — honest ACCEPT, lying REJECT, ZK. Self-hosted byte-identical. (`heval`'s first-match selection already returned multi-wire values, so only the circuit side changed. Nested-ADT fields — a field that is itself an ADT — remain the next layer.)

## [5.3.0] — 2026-05-26 — Real Glass source with ADTs → a zero-knowledge proof (multi-wire values)
- **The source→ZK bridge handles algebraic data types over real prism source.** [`prove_source_adt_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_adt_zk.glass) generalizes the bridge's circuit value from a single wire to a **multi-wire list** `[tag, f0, f1, …]` (a scalar is `[w]`; an ADT `Ctor(a, b)` is `[tag, wa, wb]`, where `tag` is the constructor's index in its type declaration). Real prism `ECtor` builds such a value; a `match` with `PCtor(C, vars)` dispatches on wire 0 (is-zero(tag − ctor_tag), inverse hint on an input wire) and binds the pattern variables to the field wires. `cgen`/`heval` thread multi-wire values through every form. Demo: `type Shape = Circle(Int) | Rect(Int, Int); fn area(s) = match s { Circle(r) => 3·r·r; Rect(w, h) => w·h }; area(Circle(inp))` over a *private* `inp` proves `area = 27`: honest ACCEPT, lying REJECT, two blinding seeds give different openings (zero-knowledge). Self-hosted byte-identical. (Scope: flat ADTs with scalar fields; nested-ADT fields and ADT-returning matches are the next layer.)

## [5.2.0] — 2026-05-26 — Structured ADT match, in zero-knowledge
- **`prove_adt_zk.glass` proves a structured ADT match succinct + zero-knowledge.** Upgrades `prove_adt`'s sound-RLC structured match to the blinded F_{p⁴} FRI STARK. An ADT value is a tagged tuple `(tag, f0, f1)`; `match s { Circle(r) => 3·r·r; Rect(w, h) => w·h }` dispatches on the tag (is-zero gadget, inverse hint on an input wire), binds the field wires, and multiplexes the bodies (first-match). The ADT value is *private*; a `qassert` binds the match output to a public claim `R`. Proves "I know an `s` with `area(s) = R`" (R = 27): honest ACCEPT, lying REJECT, two blinding seeds give different openings (zero-knowledge). Self-hosted byte-identical. (Hand-shaped `(tag, f0, f1)` representation — wiring prism's real `ECtor`/`PCtor` through the general source bridge, where every value becomes multi-wire, is the larger follow-on.)

## [5.1.0] — 2026-05-26 — The source→ZK bridge gains scalar `match`
- **`prove_source_zk` now proves real `match` expressions.** [`prove_source_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_zk.glass) extends the bridge with scalar pattern dispatch: `match x { 7 => 100; k => k * k }`. Each arm becomes a selector (`PInt`/`PBool` via the is-zero gadget — consuming an inverse hint; `PVar`/`PWild` always match), combined first-match style (`eff = sel·(1−matched)`, `result += eff·body`, `matched += eff`) so the circuit is branchless. The hint pre-pass (`heval`) was extended to collect each arm's selector hint and all bodies' hints in the exact order `cgen_match` consumes them. Demo: `fn grade(x) = match x { 7 => 100; k => k * k }` over a private input proves `grade(inp) = 100` (honest ACCEPT). Self-hosted byte-identical. (`PCtor`/`PTuple`/`PRecord`/`PStr` patterns are treated as non-matching — structured-pattern circuits are the next step.)

## [5.0.0] — 2026-05-26 — The thesis, realized: real branching Glass source → a zero-knowledge proof
*A milestone release (not a breaking change). The founding bet — write a Glass function, get a zero-knowledge proof of its result — is now real end to end: real multi-function Glass source with control flow, parsed by Glass's own front end, lowered to a circuit, and proven succinct + zero-knowledge. Alongside, this session built a complete from-scratch zk-STARK on the production Goldilocks field (v4.95–v4.98). Glass remains a research language (see LANG.md), not production-hardened.*

- **`prove_source_zk` now proves real branching Glass source.** [`prove_source_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_zk.glass) extends the unified source→ZK bridge from arithmetic to a real control-flow subset: `==`/`!=`, `&&`/`||`/`not`, and `if`. The `==` is an is-zero gadget (`out = 1 − d·inv`, with `d·out == 0` forcing `out = [d==0]`); `if` is a multiplexer (`out = f + c·(t−f)`, condition constrained boolean). Both need an inverse *hint* that can't be a gate output — so a pre-pass (`heval`) evaluates the program to compute the hints and lays them on input wires in the exact order `cgen` consumes them. Demo: `fn classify(x) = if x == 7 then 100 else x * x` over a *private* input proves "I know an input with `classify(input) = 100`" — honest ACCEPT, lying REJECT, two blinding seeds give different openings (ZK). Self-hosted byte-identical. (Order comparisons `<`/`>` would add a heavy range gadget and stay in the RLC bridge for now.)

## [4.99.0] — 2026-05-26 — Real Glass source → a succinct, zero-knowledge proof (unified)
- **The thesis, end to end in one file.** [`prove_source_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_source_zk.glass) joins the two halves that lived apart: the real-source front end (prism parses an actual multi-function Glass program) and the succinct, zero-knowledge backend (the blinded F_{p⁴} FRI STARK). A program `fn sq … fn cube … fn f … f(inp)` is parsed by Glass's own front end, lowered to a circuit (function calls inlined, arithmetic → add/mul/sub gates) with a `qassert` gate binding the output wire to a public claim `R`, then proven with the blinded FRI STARK. With a *private* input, it proves "I know an input with `f(input) = R`" (R = 25): honest ACCEPT, lying about R REJECTs, two blinding seeds verify with different openings (zero-knowledge). Self-hosted byte-identical. Scope: arithmetic + `let` + calls — the hint-free subset that lowers directly to trace rows (`==`/`if` need an inverse-hint input wire, the RLC bridge's domain).

## [4.98.0] — 2026-05-26 — Zero-knowledge over Goldilocks (the arc complete)
- **The full zk-STARK shape, now on the production field.** [`frost_goldilocks_zk.glass`](examples/frost/frost_goldilocks_zk.glass) adds the last property — zero-knowledge — to the Goldilocks FRI via blinding: the codeword is masked with a random low-degree polynomial R (degree below the fold-to-constant bound), so f + R still folds to a constant and the proof ACCEPTs, while the committed Merkle root and every opened value are randomized. Two independent blinding seeds produce two different valid proofs of the same statement (both ACCEPT; layer-0 commitment differs; opened value #5 differs) — the verifier learns only "low-degree", nothing about the codeword. **Sound + committed + zero-knowledge, over Goldilocks**, int64-safe and dogfooded. This completes the Goldilocks arc: field → FRI fold → F_{p²} challenge → committed/query-verified → zero-knowledge.

## [4.97.0] — 2026-05-25 — A committed, query-verified FRI over Goldilocks
- **The cryptographic STARK core, complete on the production field.** [`frost_goldilocks_stark.glass`](examples/frost/frost_goldilocks_stark.glass) brings all three FRI soundness mechanisms together over Goldilocks: each layer's codeword is **Merkle-committed** (a Goldilocks MiMC hash with the x⁷ S-box), the fold **challenge β ∈ F_{p²}** is derived from the root (Fiat-Shamir), and the verifier **samples query positions** from the transcript, opens each `(f(x), f(−x))` pair with a Merkle path, recomputes the fold, and checks it equals the next layer. An honest low-degree codeword ACCEPTs (0/12 faults); a faked final layer REJECTs (12/12 — caught at every query). All int64-safe, dogfooded byte-identical — the Baby Bear `frost_crypto` capstone, now on the field real provers use. (Next: blinding → a full zero-knowledge STARK over Goldilocks.)

## [4.96.0] — 2026-05-25 — F_{p²} over Goldilocks: a cryptographic challenge space
- **FRI over Goldilocks gains cryptographic soundness.** [`frost_goldilocks_ext.glass`](examples/frost/frost_goldilocks_ext.glass) builds the degree-2 extension F_{p²} = F_p[X]/(X² − 7) over Goldilocks (W = 7 is a non-residue, 7^((p−1)/2) = −1). Since p ≈ 2⁶⁴, F_{p²} ≈ 2¹²⁸ — a challenge space too large to guess. Inversion stays int64-safe via the norm (a⁻¹ = conj(a)·N(a)⁻¹, N(a) ∈ F_p inverted by the base Fermat inverse). FRI now folds with β ∈ F_{p²} (≈2¹²⁸ per-round soundness instead of a guessable 2⁶⁴): a low-degree codeword folds to a constant, a tampered one doesn't. All int64-safe, dogfooded byte-identical. (Mirrors the Baby Bear arc frost_fri → frost_fri_ext; next is Merkle + Fiat-Shamir over Goldilocks.)

## [4.95.0] — 2026-05-25 — FRI over Goldilocks
- **The STARK's core engine now runs over the real field.** [`frost_goldilocks_fri.glass`](examples/frost/frost_goldilocks_fri.glass) runs the FRI low-degree test over Goldilocks (p = 2⁶⁴ − 2³² + 1): the evaluation domain is a genuine 2ᵏ-th-root-of-unity subgroup (built from the field's 2-adicity), the fold `(f(x)+f(−x))/2 + β·(f(x)−f(−x))/(2x)` uses the limb-walked inverse, and a low-degree codeword folds to a constant while a tampered one does not. Every step is int64-safe, so it dogfoods byte-identical — FRI over a production-grade field, not toy Baby Bear. (Base-field β for now; the degree-2 extension challenge space and Merkle/Fiat-Shamir are the next layers, mirroring how the Baby Bear path grew.)

## [4.94.0] — 2026-05-25 — A hash preimage in zero-knowledge, and the Goldilocks field
- **The canonical ZK statement — knowledge of a hash preimage.** [`prove_preimage_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_preimage_zk.glass) proves *"I know a secret x such that Hash(x) = H"* in zero-knowledge. `Hash` is a 2-to-1 compression built from Poseidon's own heart — the x⁷ S-box, round constants, and the MDS mix `[[2,3,1],[1,2,3],[3,1,2]]` — lowered gate-for-gate into a Frost circuit, with the secret preimage on private input wires and a `qassert` forcing the truncated permutation output to the public digest. Proven by the blinded F_{p⁴} FRI STARK: honest ACCEPT, wrong preimage REJECT, two blinding seeds give different openings. Rounds are reduced so the trace dogfoods on the interpreter; the full 30-round Poseidon runs the same way (~1.2s native).
- **The Goldilocks field, from scratch, int64-safe.** [`frost_goldilocks.glass`](examples/frost/frost_goldilocks.glass) builds p = 2⁶⁴ − 2³² + 1 — the field Plonky2/RISC Zero run on — with its signature division-free reduction (2⁶⁴ ≡ 2³² − 1), a real Fermat inverse (p − 2 overflows int64, so the exponent is walked in base-2¹⁶ limbs too), and the 2³²-th root of unity (32 NTT layers). Every step stays inside int64, so it dogfoods byte-identical — the int64 wall is genuinely lifted, not hidden by Python's big ints.

## [4.93.0] — 2026-05-25 — A FRI fold step, verified in zero-knowledge
- **H3 advances: the recursion step is now succinct and blind.** [`prove_recursion_zk.glass`](examples/prove/prove_recursion_zk.glass) takes the FRI fold check — `fold(f(x), f(-x)) = (f(x)+f(-x))/2 + β·(f(x)−f(-x))/(2x)` — and lowers it through the blinded F_{p⁴} FRI STARK (the `prove_zk` backend), so the verifier's own fold step is proven in zero-knowledge: the opened values stay private. Division rides as input-wire inverse hints with `(2x)·inv == 1` `qassert` gates. Honest fold step ACCEPTs, a tampered fold REJECTs, and two blinding seeds verify with different quotient openings. Self-hosted byte-identical; ~1.1s native vs ~46s interpreted (~42×) — the native-substrate payoff on a genuinely heavy circuit.

## [4.92.0] — 2026-05-25 — Top-level functions self-host as values
- A bare top-level function used as a first-class value (`map(xs, inc)`) now self-hosts: `glassc` gains an eta-expansion pre-pass that rewrites it to an arity-saturated lambda (`fn(a) -> inc(a)`) before codegen, which compiles to a proper closure. Call heads and shadowing locals are untouched, so the pass is a no-op on code that doesn't use a bare fn as a value — the bootstrap fixpoint still closes byte-identically (972 lines of C, gen1 == gen2); suite 381/381.
- **This closes the last self-hosting divergence.** The reference interpreter and the self-hosted compiler now agree on the entire practical language — the culmination of the parser-parity audit (v4.89–v4.92).

## [4.91.0] — 2026-05-25 — Record patterns self-host
- Record patterns in `match` (`Point { x, y } => …`) now parse in `prism` and compile through `glassc` — they previously ran on the reference interpreter and Quartz but not the self-hosted native compiler. With this, the parser-parity audit has closed **every practical divergence**: the reference, Quartz, and the self-hosted compiler now agree on the whole language. Bootstrap fixpoint byte-identical (972 lines of C, gen1 == gen2); suite 381/381.

## [4.90.0] — 2026-05-25 — The prelude self-hosts
- The entire standard prelude now compiles through the **self-hosted** compiler, not just the reference: `fst`, `snd`, `reverse`, `map_option`, `bind_option`, and `map_result` join `bind_result`/`string_contains` — all emitted by `glassc` (Pair field access, a `q_reverse` list walker, and closure-applying Option/Result mappers built on `q_apply1`). Every prelude function now runs identically on the interpreter, Quartz, and the self-hosted compiler. Bootstrap fixpoint byte-identical (963 lines of C, gen1 == gen2); suite 381/381.

## [4.89.0] — 2026-05-25 — Parser parity: reference ⟷ self-hosted front end
- A parser-parity audit aligned the reference interpreter (`glass.py`) with the self-hosted front end (`prism`), so a program that runs on `glass` is one that self-hosts:
  - **chained comparison** (`a == b == c`) is now a parse error in the reference too — comparison operators don't associate; write `(a == b) == c`.
  - **negative integer literals** (`-5`) now lex in prism, matching the reference's `-?\d+` — examples that used them (`quartz/lookup`, `basic/option_result`) now self-host.
  - **fixed-length list patterns** (`[a, b]`) now parse in the reference, matching prism, alongside the `[x, ...rest]` cons form.
- Documented the two remaining self-hosting gaps honestly in [`docs/self-hosting.md`](docs/self-hosting.md): record patterns in `match` (interpreter + Quartz, not prism) and a bare top-level function used as a value (interpreter only — wrap it in a lambda). Bootstrap fixpoint re-verified byte-identical; suite 381/381.

## [4.88.0] — 2026-05-25 — Poseidon: a permutation-based hash
- Frost gains **Poseidon**, the hash production STARKs actually use, built from scratch: an `x⁷` S-box (a real *permutation* on Baby Bear — MiMC's `x⁵` is not, since 5 ∣ p−1), full + partial rounds, and an MDS mixing layer. It even proves the S-box is a bijection — `(x⁷)^d == x` for `d = 7⁻¹ mod (p−1)` — and powers a Poseidon Merkle root. A genuine upgrade over the toy MiMC. (`examples/frost/frost_poseidon.glass`)
- Frost's README gains a **"Sharper primitives"** section gathering the drop-in upgrades: Poseidon, the recursive O(n log n) NTT, and the 128-bit bignum field.

## [4.87.0] — 2026-05-25 — A faster reference interpreter
- The reference interpreter (`glass.py`) runs the heavy STARK demos **~24% faster** — `dataclass(slots=True)` on the runtime value classes (Python 3.10+, graceful on 3.9), plus inlining the leaf-operand cases (`Ident` / `IntLit` / `BinOp`) in the binop, function-call, and tail-call paths to skip millions of `eval_expr` dispatch calls. Output is byte-identical: suite 381/381, dogfoods unchanged, Python 3.9 ≡ 3.12.
- **MIN/MAX now support `WHERE`**, so every aggregate (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY) filters uniformly — each proven over the same committed table. (`examples/prove/prove_pane.glass`)

## [4.86.0] — 2026-05-25 — The complete aggregate set
- Pane's query algebra (and its Frost proof backend) now covers the full analytics surface over a committed private table: **SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX, and GROUP BY**, on top of equality / boolean / arithmetic / `<`–`>` range filters. (`examples/pane/pane.glass`, `examples/prove/prove_pane.glass`)
- **AVG** is revealed as a proven `sum` + `count` (a finite field has no exact division, so the verifier forms the average); **MIN/MAX** claim a value and prove it is both a *bound* (via the range gadget) and *present* (via an inverse hint); **GROUP BY** decomposes into per-group filtered sums — each proven over the *same* committed table.
- `run_query` and the prover stay in lockstep: the circuit ACCEPTs exactly when its answer equals the reference interpreter's.

## [4.85.0] — 2026-05-25 — Pane ⊕ Frost: zero-knowledge queries
- The founding vision, realized: commit a **private table**, then prove the result of a query — revealing only the commitment, the query, and the answer, never a row. (`examples/prove/prove_query`)
- **Frost as a second backend over the real Pane query algebra**: a genuine Pane `Query` value (`SumQ`/`CountQ`/`Where`) is *lowered* into a Frost circuit — equality, booleans, arithmetic, and `<`/`>` range comparisons — with one AST and two evaluators (`run_query` interprets, `prove_pane` proves) kept honest by their agreement. (`examples/prove/prove_pane`)
- **A committed-table query in zero-knowledge**: a SUM, and a `WHERE`-filtered SUM, over a committed private column — lowered to the blinded F_{p⁴} FRI STARK, succinct and leaking nothing. The PLONK gate identity gains a `qassert` selector so the binding/result assertions and the filter's is-zero gadget ride inside the low-degree quotient. (`examples/prove/prove_query_zk`)
- The reference interpreter now **rejects uppercase value bindings** — an uppercase name is a constructor, and binding one as a value silently miscompiled — closing a glass.py ⟷ compiler divergence.

## [4.84.0] — 2026-05-25 — A 128-bit bignum field, a hardened runtime, and a written semantics
- A **production-width field**: a 128-bit prime (2¹²⁸ − 159) built from base-2¹⁶ bignum limbs — arithmetic that overflows a single int64 now works limb-by-limb, and self-hosts byte-for-byte. (`examples/frost/frost_field`)
- **Hardened the native runtime**: the emitted `run_command` uses process-unique temp files with cleanup (no more fixed-`/tmp` clobber); the bootstrap fixpoint still closes byte-identically.
- **Tooling**: `dogfood.sh` runs the self-host differential check in one command, and `docs/semantics.md` writes down Glass's big-step operational semantics.

## [4.83.0] — 2026-05-25 — Structured match, a unified bridge, and self-host tooling
- The prove bridge compiles structured **`match` on ADTs** — a value becomes a `(tag, fields…)` wire-tuple, dispatched by tag and bound by field. (`examples/prove/prove_adt`)
- A **unified front end** proves real multi-function Glass programs — function calls, `match`, `if`, `==`, and arithmetic all interacting. (`examples/prove/prove_full`)
- **`dogfood.sh`** runs any file on both `glass.py` and the self-hosted compiler and checks byte-identical output — the differential-testing discipline as one command; plus a `glass --quiet` flag that suppresses declaration echoes. (`examples/selfhost/dogfood.sh`)

## [4.82.0] — 2026-05-25 — The prove bridge closes the loop: Glass source → a succinct, zero-knowledge proof
- Write a Glass function, get a STARK proof of its execution that is sound, succinct, *and* zero-knowledge — the circuit is lowered through a PLONK arithmetization, copy constraints (a z-accumulator permutation), a gate-constraint quotient, and a blinded FRI over F_{p⁴}. (`examples/prove/prove_stark`, `prove_copy`, `prove_quotient`, `prove_zk`, `prove_zperm`)
- The bridge now also handles **function calls** (by inlining) and **`match`** (scalar dispatch), over real prism-parsed Glass. (`prove_calls`, `prove_match`)
- Developer experience: a standard **prelude** (`examples/lib/prelude.glass` — `nth`, `take`/`drop`, `zip`, Option/Result helpers), a `glass --version` flag, and parser/type diagnostics that *explain* the common gotchas (uppercase = constructor, tuple-vs-`Pair`).
- Performance: a recursive **O(n log n) NTT** replaces the O(n²) transform under evaluate/interpolate/FRI. (`frost_ntt`)

## [4.81.0] — 2026-05-24 — Docs & repo: a cinematic pass
- README rewritten around the macro idea — transparency, carried from a type signature to a zero-knowledge proof.
- Examples reorganized so the repo reads itself: Frost split into its own folder, per-folder guides, a navigation index.

## [4.80.0] — 2026-05-24 — The prove bridge: write Glass, get a proof
- A Glass expression compiles to a Frost circuit + witness and is proved correct for a secret input.
- `prove_glass` parses REAL Glass source with Glass's own front end (prism) and proves it — arithmetic, comparisons, booleans, `if`/`let`.
